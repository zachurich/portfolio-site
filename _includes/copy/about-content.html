I learned through hours of teaching myself most of what I know about design and business through my own passion and interests in people I admire and facets of the digital design world. Iâ€™ve tried everything from animation to 3D modeling and decided to dedicate my focus to Branding, Illustration, and UI/UX Design for the past few years. During this time, I was able to get my first professional design job at 19, but decided to finish school as a full-time student while working at the same time.

I recently graduated from Belmont University with a BFA in Design Communications and a minor in Design Administration and was awarded the highest possible grade and best in show for my portfolio my senior year of college. I am currently working at Satchel Health as a Product Designer and Illustrator helping build the future of telemedicine while learning to become a Front-End Web Developer. I have also started a few side projects to help fuel my creativity all under the parent brand Quarry.
