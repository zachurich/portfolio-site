<h1>My Story</h1>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>My job isn't just to craft beautiful things, but to establish and operate within proven systems to make products that are usable, functional, and valuable. I look for the root goal of the project at hand, and create a product around that singular idea. Stripping away all the unnecessary frills that bog down many businesses in order to create a product that can be used by many is an art, and is something I strive to refine with each project I tackle.</p>
</br>
<p>I've always been interested in art and technology, but it wasn't until I started creating art WITH technology that I discovered my passion. Interface design caught my interest early on, but simply crafting static designs wasn't enough. I needed to do and learn more about the industry beyond simply creating trendy and flashy eye-pleasers. I wanted to make something I could use and interact with. Because of this desire, I doubled down, shifted my focus, and started learning as much as I could about developing for the web.</p>
</br>
<p>While I consider myself a front-end web developer, I am first and fore-most a life-long learner. I still have alot to learn, and am practicing at my craft daily. My goal is to know and be proficient in as much as I can in this industry, and I hope to use my skills to create products people can enjoy using and find value in.</p>
