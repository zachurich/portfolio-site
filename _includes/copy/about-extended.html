<h1>My Story</h1>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>Design caught my eye early on out of an awareness of poor aesthetic and user experience. Since then, I've worked to learn
what makes things look and feel pleasing and functional in hopes to improve the world around me.</p>
</br>
<p>I believe that my time playing video games and browsing the web at a young age spurred this awareness for UI, naturally
leaving me to want to design my own experiences. Just being able to design an interface wasn't enough though.
I was curious (still am) as to how it all worked. I set out on a journey to learn, going from being afraid
of writing a few lines of code to finding it extremely rewarding and satisfying.</p>
</br>
<p>Today, I consider myself a Front-end Developer, but I'm first and foremost a life long learner of functional aethetic and frontend web technologies. My curiousity to figure out how visuals and logic can work together to create good products drives
my passion to learn more.</p>
