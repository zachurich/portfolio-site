<h1>My Story</h1>
<div class="divider"></div>
<!-- <p>I picked up design early on, creating designs and illustrations with personality. After trying my hand at many different areas of design, I fell in love with interface. I'd been using them all my life, but never stopped to think about the care and attention to detail it takes to create a great user experience.</p>
</br>
<p>After finding my passion, I realized that creating static designs wasn't enough. I needed to do more and learn more in order to be able to fully build out my ideas. I scrambled through every online resource I could find to learn how to code, and soon found myself able to competently create things I'd never dreamed of when I first started. Learning to code has been a challenge, but is one of the most rewarding things I've ever chosen to pursue.</p>
</br>
<p>Today, I call myself a Front-end developer, but I'm first and foremost a life-long learner. My journey to learn code isn't finished, I'm just getting started.</p> -->

<p>Design caught my eye early on out of an awareness of poor aethetic and user experience. Since then, I've worked to learn
what makes things look and feel pleasing and functional in hopes to improve the world around me.</p>
</br>
<p>I believe that my time playing video games and browsing the web at a young age spurred this awareness for UI, naturally
leaving me to want to design my own experiences. Just being able to design an interface wasn't enough though.
I was curious (still am) as to how it all worked. I set out on a journey to learn, going from being afraid
of writing a few lines of code to finding it extremely rewarding and satisfying.</p>
</br>
<p>Today, I consider myself a Front-end Developer, but I'm first and foremost a life long learner of functional aethetic and frontend web technologies. My curiousity to figure out how visuals and logic can work together to create good products drives
my passion to learn more.</p>
