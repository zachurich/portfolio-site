<p>Santa's Helpers, Inc. is a non-profit organization in Saint Louis specializing in providing Christmas for underpriviledged familes. A team of designers, content-strategists, and I as the developer worked together to create this new online face for the organization. I was responsible for developing this site in Wordpress, creating a custom theme that would provide the system the organization would need to maintain and update their own site as needed in the future.

<p>I also contributed to the design process, providing creative feedback and creating some nifty icons for the site's About page.
