<p>AskBryan is a Wordpress site created for a friend of mine.
   The goal of the project was to build a system
   for users to submit questions via form.
   Bryan would then go in and answer each question,
   using his unique wisdom to shed light on various topics.

<p>Leveraging Wordpress' powerful features,
   I created a custom theme that allowed questions
   to populate the front-end in a masonry layout.
