<p>Quotes For Creatives is an idea I had a while back to feature quotes from those who have influenced me
  the most in my creative endeavors. The goal was to showcase curated quotes from creatives to help inspire other creatives
  in their journey through learning design and/or code.

<p>The final product is an interface that showcases these quotes, with the ability to click to load a new random quote from the
  the curated list.
