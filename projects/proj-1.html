<p> Backpack is higher-education LMS app-concept,
  featuring the ability to upload and download documents, check grades, interact with classmates and instructors, and store eBooks.
  While many of these systems exist on the market, few seem to capture a sense of personality and ease-of-use.

<p>The goal with this concept was to design and code a responsive landing page for the app itself, implementing
   a number of design assets such as icons and
   the in-app interface.

<p>I created these sample views to showcase the interface to the user
   wanting to learn about Backpack's features, along with some icons that
   lead the user to the desired feature's description.</p>
