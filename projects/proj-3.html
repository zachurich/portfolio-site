<p>AskBryan is a Wordpress site created for a friend of mine. The goal of the project was to build a system for users to submit questions via form. Bryan would then go in and answer each question, using his unique wisdom to shed light on various topics.

<p>Leveraging Wordpress' powerful features, I created a custom theme that allowed questions to populate the front-end in a masonry layout.

<p>Before beginning development, I designed the site's UI and various assets to give the project a fun, inviting personality.
