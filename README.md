## This is my personal web/portfolio site, built with Jekyll

### Jekyll is a ruby-based static-site generator, and has powered some big projects such as Obama's campaign site

* To get started:

```bash

# Step 1
npm install jekyll

# Step 2
jekyll serve


```

* Navigate to localhost:4000 to see the built site!

* OR, go to "http://zachurich.github.io" to skip all the above steps and just see it live!
